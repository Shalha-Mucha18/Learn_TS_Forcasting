# Learn Forecast Notebook

This project is a simple, learning-focused notebook for time series forecasting
using statistical models on a French bakery daily sales dataset.

## Contents

- `forcast_v1.ipynb` (main notebook)
- `data/daily_sales_french_bakery.csv` (dataset)
- `requiements.txt` (Python dependencies)

## Quick Start

1) Create and activate a virtual environment.
2) Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requiements.txt
```

3) Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Notes

- The notebook currently uses an absolute path to the CSV file. If you move the
  project, update the path in the data-loading cell.
